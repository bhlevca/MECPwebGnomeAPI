# These are software packages necessary to run the WebGnomeAPI web server.
# This file is designed for use with conda:
#
# so these packages can be installed with the commands:
#
#     $ conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
#
# many of the requirements are also available via pip, but they may
# have slightly different names, but you can give it a try:
#
#     $ pip install -r conda_requirements.txt
#
# All required packages should be available on the conda-forge channel
