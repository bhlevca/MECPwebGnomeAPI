This feature is under active development. At present it retrieves data from the |GSHHS|. Other shoreline 
databases may be added in the near future.

To select a region, click on the map and drag to draw a rectangle. Zoom in and out using a mouse scroll wheel or by right-clicking and dragging. Once drawn, the rectangle can not be edited -- however, it can be redrawn as needed to refine the region of interest. The rectangle will also be used to define the "Map Bounds" in the model scenario. 

Clicking **Save** will download the data and generate the map.

**Note:** At present, there is  no limit on the size of the data request. Trying to download data for very large regions at high resolutions may result in long download times, or maps that do not perform well in GNOME due to their size.
