Map Type
^^^^^^^^

Choose **Upload Shoreline** so that WebGNOME can create a map. This is necessary to determine
when oil interacts with the shoreline (oil beaching). Global shoreline 
data can be obtained in a supported format through |location_link|. If you'd like to 
use your own data to create a map, see the |location_link2|.

In idealized cases, for example, 
if you are only interested in the weathering of the oil (the oil budget), then you can choose an 
**Infinite Ocean** or **Parameterized Shoreline**.

To generate a map for a region of interest, choose the **Custom Shoreline** option.  This will access shoreline data from publicly available sources including the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline (GSHHS) database.
