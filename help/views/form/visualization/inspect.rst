This form can customize the display of particles based on their properties. Each particle represents a particular mass based on the total spil mass (or volume and density typically in the case of oil spills). Both the size and color used to display particles can be customized.

The **Display** pull down list is used to select which property to style the particles based on. By default this is set to Mass, with all particles rendered in black. The **Fade by Mass** box is checked so that if particles lose mass due to weathering processes the color will fade and ultimately disappear if all mass is lost.

Other properties to display include Surface Concentration, Viscosity, and Age. Both Surface Concentration and Viscosity include the option to use a **Preset Scale**. These scales have been designed to bin the particles using a response relevant framework -- for example, the Surface Concentration can be viewed using the "Bonn Agreement" color scale which maps concentration in (grams/square meter) to thickness classes which are colored appropriately. 

Custom color themes and binning can be designed using the **Color Scheme** and **Add/remove** options in the form. Once additional color bins are added (the default is one uniform bin), the bins can be shaded based on a color selected from the Color Scheme pull down menu. For more customization, the colorbar can be manually specified by sliding the location of breakpoints between color bins or manually entering values. Colors can also be specified by clicking on the color boxes below the colorbar.

The choices made for styling the particles will be reflected in the Legend panel. The names used in the Legend are derived from the colormap in this form if text is present -- custom text can be entered by clicking on the colorbar in the form.
