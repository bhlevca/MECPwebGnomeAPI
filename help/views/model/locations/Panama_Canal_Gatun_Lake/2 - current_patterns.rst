Current Patterns
======================================

The Panama Canal -- Lake Gatun Location File uses four current patterns to simulate circulation in the lake and flow in the canal. 

One of the currents models flow from the Chagres River down the ship canal toward the Pedro Miguel and Cocoli locks on the Pacific end. 

Another pattern simulates the flow from the Chagres River through Lake Gatun, and out the Gatun dam and Gatun and Aqua Clara locks at the north end of the lake.

A third models flow from other uncontrolled tributaries into the lake, and out at the Gatun Dam. 

The current patterns are scaled by specifying the flow into the lake from Madden Dam, and the flow out of the lake at the Pacific side locks, and at the Atlantic side locks and Gatun Dam. The uncontrolled tributary flow is scaled by the difference between the inflow and outflow values specified.

The high, medium, and low flow values were determined by statistical analysis of the flows since the expansion of the Canal in 2016. Medium flow is the median flow from the period analyzed, while the low and high are the 25% and 75% percentile flows.

A fourth circulation pattern is used to simulate wind driven flow in the lake: one pattern from NW winds and another from NE winds. These two patterns are scaled to the user supplied winds to produce a net current simulating the wind-drive circulation in the lake.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
