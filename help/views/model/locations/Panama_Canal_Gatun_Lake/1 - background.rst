About Panama Canal Gatun Lake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Panama Canal -- Lake Gatun location file covers the navigable section of Lake Gatun, and the canal from Lake Gatun to the locks on the Pacific side of the canal

This location file is one of three location files covering Panama - the others model the Atlantic entrance and approach and the Pacific entrance and approach.


Background
=============================================

The location file is designed to simulate oil spills in the area. Oil spill risk is mainly from the large amount of vessel traffic navigating through the Panama Canal, making this location important for oil spill response and response planning. 

Gatun Lake is a massive artificial lake in the middle of the Isthmus of Panama, formed by the creation of the Panama canal, which crosses through Panama from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It forms a major part of the Panama Canal, transiting ships for 33 km across the Isthmus of Panama. The lake was created between 1907 and 1913 during the creation of the Gatun Dam. 

The lake level is maintained by regulating the balance between the inflow and outflow of the lake. Major inflows are from the Chagras river, as controlled by the Madden Dam, and uncontrolled flow from smaller tributaries around the lake. Outflow is through the various locks and the Gatun Dam.

Circulation in the lake is driven primarily by flow through the lake from controlled releases from the Madden Dam and tributaries, and out the lake at Gatun (via the Gatun Dam and the the Agua Clara and Gatun locks). There is also a flow from the Chagras River entrance through the canal to the lock on the Pacific side. Finally, there is a modest current driven by the wind blowing over the surface of the lake.
