About Panama Canal Pacific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Panama Canal - Pacific location file covers the area outside the Panama Canal entrances on the Pacific side of the canal system (on the southern coast of Panama).  The area covered is the canal from the ocean sides of the Miraflores and Cocoli locks on the north, and the entrance to the canal and approaches in the Bay of Panama to the south.

This location file is one of three location files covering Panama - the others model the Atlantic entrance and approach, and Lake Gatun and the passages inside the canals.


Background
=============================================

The location file is designed to simulate oil spills at the entrance to the Panama Canal from the Pacific Ocean. Oil spill risk is mainly from the large amount of vessel traffic navigating through the Panama Canal, making this location important for oil spill response and response planning. 

In the canal entrance, the currents are primarily tidally driven -- the tidal currents are simulated with a flood current pattern tied to the tide station at Balboa, near the Bridge of the Americas. 

Outside of the entrance, in the Bay of Panama, the tidal influence continues through the ship canal, and then lessens outside the channel. Further outside the entrance to the canal, there is a coastal current in the Bay of Panama that is driven by the circulation in the greater Gulf of Panama. The current pattern simulated in GNOME captures the flow as modified by the local shoreline and bathymetry. The overall strength of the flow is determined by the larger scale circulation in the Gulf of Panama. Typically, the flow is counter-clockwise, and about 0.3 knots (0.15 m/s) at the scaling location, located southwest of the entrance at: 8.7534°N--79.6358°W.
