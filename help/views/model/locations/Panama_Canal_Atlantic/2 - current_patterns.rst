Current Patterns
======================================

Wind-driven circulation patterns within Limon Bay are represented by a combination of two wind patterns, one from northeast winds and another from northwest winds (90 degrees apart). These two patterns are combined linearly to produce a current pattern appropriate for the user-defined wind field. Current velocity is scaled linearly with wind stress calculated from the user's wind field.

The current pattern for offshore of Limon Bay and Colón is defined to represent the predominant west to east currents in this region of the Caribbean Sea. The velocity magnitudes of the current pattern are scaled to data collected by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) offshore of the breakwater entrance to Limon Bay (ACP Report HID-2013-06, 2013). 

Global circulation models do not have high enough resolution to predict the needed detail for  transport outside of Limon Bay, but they do capture the general flow in the Caribbean Sea and can be used to scale the more local current pattern. One source of results from global circulation model is the NOAA IOOS EDS (https://eds.ioos.us/map/). There are currently two global models accessible through that system: The US Navy Global Ocean Forecast System (GOFS), and the NOAA Real Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS). The results from these models can be selected in the IOOS EDS Viewer, and the predicted velocities at a specified point can be determined. Then the GNOME coastal current scale should be set to the approximate value near the location: 9.39°N--79.93°W.

The current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
